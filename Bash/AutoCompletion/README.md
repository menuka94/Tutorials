### Notes
#### COMPREPLY
* An array variable from which Bash reads the possible completions generated by a shell function invoked by the programmable completion facility
We can also see how we found the current word using the array COMP_WORDS to find both the current and the previous word by looking them up:

    #### COMP_WORDS
    * An array variable consisting of the individual words in the current command line. This variable is available only in shell functions invoked by the programmable completion facilities.

    #### COMP_CWORD
    * An index into ${COMP_WORDS} of the word containing the current cursor position. This variable is available only in shell functions invoked by the programmable completion facilities
